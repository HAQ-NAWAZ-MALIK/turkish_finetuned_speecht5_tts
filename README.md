### usage


```
# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-to-audio", model="Omarrran/english_speecht5_finetuned")

```

OR
```

# Load model directly
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForTextToSpectrogram

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Omarrran/turkish_finetuned_speecht5_tts")
model = AutoModelForTextToSpectrogram.from_pretrained("Omarrran/turkish_finetuned_speecht5_tts")
```
## Methodology

### Model Selection
We chose microsoft/speecht5_tts as our base model due to its:
- Robust multilingual capabilities
- Strong performance on various speech synthesis tasks
- Active community support and documentation
- Flexibility for fine-tuning

### Dataset Preparation
The training process utilized a carefully curated Turkish speech dataset with the following characteristics:
- High-quality audio recordings with native Turkish speakers
- Diverse phonetic coverage
- Clean transcriptions and alignments
- Balanced gender representation
- Various speaking styles and prosody patterns

### Fine-tuning Process
The model was fine-tuned using the following hyperparameters:
- Learning rate: 0.0001
- Train batch size: 4 (32 with gradient accumulation)
- Gradient accumulation steps: 8
- Training steps: 600
- Warmup steps: 100
- Optimizer: Adam (β1=0.9, β2=0.999, ε=1e-08)
- Learning rate scheduler: Linear with warmup
